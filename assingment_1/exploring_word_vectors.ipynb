Here, you will explore two types of word vectors: those derived from *co-occurrence matrices*, and those derived via *GloVe*.\n",

        "**Note on Terminology:** The terms \"word vectors\" and \"word embeddings\" are often used interchangeably. The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, \"*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*\"."

As a result, similar words will often be spoken or written along with a shared subset of words, i.e., contexts. By examining these contexts, we can try to develop embeddings for our words. With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) or [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190530091127/https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."

In the future, a good way to make a plot is to look at [the Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html), find a plot that looks somewhat like what you want, and adapt the code they give."

Here, we shall explore the embeddings produced by GloVe. Please revisit the class notes and lecture slides for more details on the word2vec and GloVe algorithms. If you're feeling adventurous, challenge yourself and try reading [GloVe's original paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf).\n",

If you've run these cells before, rerunning them will load the model without redownloading it, which will take about 1 to 2 minutes."

        "### Question 2.2: Words with Multiple Meanings (1.5 points) [code + written]\n",
        "Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms ). Find a word with *at least two different meanings* such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from *both* meanings. For example, \"leaves\" has both \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meaning in the top 10, and \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\". You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please state the word you discover and the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Why do you think many of the polysemous or homonymic words you tried didn't work (i.e. the top-10 most similar words only contain **one** of the meanings of the words)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: You should use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 most similar words. This function ranks all other words in the vocabulary with respect to their cosine similarity to the given word. For further assistance, please check the __[GenSim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html#gensim.models.keyedvectors.FastTextKeyedVectors.most_similar)__."
